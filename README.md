# Moving Cube

This repository contains a web application that displays a cube (div element) on the screen and controls its movement using JavaScript. The cube moves to a new random position every 2 seconds and changes its styles such as color, size, and transparency randomly.

## Features

1. **Create a Basic Box**:
    - A `div` element is created in the HTML file.
    - Basic styles such as size, position, and background color are defined in CSS.

2. **Add Movement and Style Changes with JavaScript**:
    - The cube moves to a new random position every 2 seconds.
    - Styles such as color, size, and transparency are changed randomly using JavaScript.

## How It Works

### 1. Creating the Box

- An HTML `div` element is used to create the cube.
- CSS is used to define the initial size, position, and background color of the cube.

### 2. Moving the Cube and Changing Styles

- JavaScript is used to move the cube to a new random position every 2 seconds using the `setInterval` function.
- Styles such as color, size, and transparency are changed randomly using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
